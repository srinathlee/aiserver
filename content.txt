hello friends welcome back to my youtube channel basic or service not learning so
in this video is the first video of service not training session or I can
say service not training series the series where we will cover each and every
topic mentioned in this syllabus so I will be covering all these topics one by
one in videos so in today's video I am going to cover this first and second the
introduction to service now the configuring users and groups and
administration so the first part is basically a theoretical and the second
part is basically a implementation in service not instance that how to create
users how to create groups how to create roles right what is users what are
groups what are roles in service now okay so let's see what we are going to
cover in this video in this video I will give you a brief of service now
basically service not introduction we will talk about users we will talk about
roles we will talk about groups and we will also implement a use case the use
case is like how to create a user how to create a custom roles how to create a
groups in service now how to assign roles to user directly how to assign
roles to group how to add user to group okay if we adding a role right so we
have to remove the role as well right so how to remove role from the users and how to
remove roles from the groups okay so these all use courses we are going to
cover in today's video okay so let's start with for service now introduction
so that is basically a theoretical part so our service now is basically a
product of service now Inc which is an American cloud-based IT management
company it was founded in 2004 by Fred Ludi and its headquarters is in Santa
Clara California service now is a cloud-based IT management tool so which
is used to automate business processes and provides best service to customers
and encourages best practices in managing all services business service
now was first introduced as ITSM tool used for various IT activities such as asset
management incident management change management problem management knowledge
management CMDB etc okay so basically these incident management change
management asset management problem management
these are basically ITSM applications okay these are very basic
applications or a default applications which is given by the service now and
most of the companies are working on incident management change management I
believe okay so these are the very basic modules incident management and change
management so but now service now becomes a huge and serves a lot of other
applications as well such as ITOM applications and ITBM applications
okay so as we move forward with other sections of this training sessions then
we will also cover this ITOM applications and ITBM applications
what all ITOM application service now have what all ITBM applications
service now have we will also talk about this ITSM applications in details
that what exactly the incident management process is what exactly the
change management process is okay problem management process and all okay
so we will cover all these things in later videos as well okay so this is
basically an introduction session of service now so we are only covering
these vertical sections only. So service now platform supports several database technologies such as
masculine Oracle etc service now platform is written in Java apps are
written in JavaScripts okay so if you are learning a service now you should
have a basic knowledge of JavaScript you should you must have a basic knowledge
of AngularJS you must have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS at least okay
if you are want to proceed your career in service now development okay but if
you are proceeding your career in service now administration or if you are
proceeding your career in service now functional consultant okay so doesn't
mean that you know JavaScript or not okay so let's see so this is basically a
very brief introduction of service now because most of the time interviewer
ask like what is service now certainly you should be aware of that what is
service now what exactly is the tool is this tool is basically for ITSM, ITBM
and IT own applications it's a cloud-based IT management tool okay so
here now let's see what is users okay so you know that each and every application
either it is a software it is a web application or any application so it is
nothing without users okay in service now user is basically those individuals
who can access service now instance okay and to create users in service now user
admin or IT role is required okay so let's navigate to service now
application so that we can understand it how we can create users and from where
we can create users okay so friends this is my service now personal developer
instance okay if you are not aware of like what is a personal development
instance so I will tell you that this is basically an instance which is provided
by service now this is free of cost you can create your access and you can
create your instance directly so I have already posted a video you can check in
my playlist so where you can find that how to create your personal developer
instance okay so you can create your personal developer instance once you
create that then you have an admin access of that instance see okay and
then you can perform the activities which are which I am going to perform
okay and you can also explore the things of service now instance so we are
talking about users so before we start with users I'll give you a little brief
on this application first see whatever we are looking here in the left-hand
side navigation see these are the applications which are provided by
service now by default is service this personal development instance okay there
are lots of application see okay see I was talking about change
right change problem incident see you have access here you can access those
applications you can do hands-on if you are you want to become an incident
manager or you want to become a problem manager or change manager okay you can
do hands-on over here okay we have different applications here even though
we have a development applications also here okay so if you want to do
development in service now you will need admin access from where you can access
the applications like system definition see from here we can do development
activities okay there are lots of other applications as well so these are the
applications which are provided by service now on the left-hand
navigation each and every applications have different different modules okay
modules means like in incident we have module called create new this basically
used to create a incident assigned to me is a different list view and this open
is basically list view so we have different different modules available in
each and every applications each and every module is is for performing
different activities okay same as here we have see profile in
personnel user elevate role okay here we have settings which is tell us that
what updates that we are using in development sections what applications
we are using right like notifications if you want to create some personal
notifications or remove some notifications then you can use it from
here forms list themes generals okay this is basically a search we can say
global search you can search anything from here okay whatever data is
available in service now will be displayed to you okay so okay so this is
basically a service now application so when we move forward with different
different tutorials or different different training sessions and you will
be come to know more about each and everything okay so now let's move to
user part first so so to create a user or to find out from where to create a
user tap user this filter navigator once you tap user see it gives us a filter
result so scroll down and the user administration see we have modules
called users groups and rules okay so we are going to cover these users groups
and rules today in this video okay so what I am going to do I am going to open
this user in a new tab see we have five hundred ninety users in this system
right now we are going to create more users today so from here we can create a
new user and this icon is basically see this gear icon is basically for
personalizing the list that what all columns you want to display like this is
the selected columns if you want to add more columns we can add from here like
I am saying first name okay so see this custom come over here I am just setting
it position where I want to display it I say okay okay once I personalize the
list see the first name is displaying over here so it means this particular
gear icon is used to customize this okay what you want to see what you want to
remove from here okay and this is basically filtration that what all
records you can create your own query over here let's say I am saying that
active is true means those user are active okay active is to display to me
okay so it will display me all the users those who are active see so it will
filter the results so this is basically used for filtration this is basically
used for personalization okay so these two I this to functionality you will get
for each and every list view in service now okay so now let's come back to users
okay so I am going to create a new user click on this new button so once you
click on new button see we have a form available so we have to fill this form
so as I told you that earlier that to create a user a person need a ITIL role
or a user underscore admin role or admin role right to create a user so user ID is
basically a login ID so I am saying I am giving a demo so I am saying demo user
okay the first name is demo okay the name you can give any name okay title if
you want to give this is not mandatory so I am not giving it see this is
mandatory and this is not mandatory department I am not giving I am saying
password 123 okay password needs reset if I checked it it means when the
person login the system this user first time login the system that he need to
reset the password this logged out basically if I checked it it means user
is active in the system but he cannot he cannot do any login if I click on this
okay this basically happens like if a person enters a password more than three
times along password then the system get locked out means he had to reset the
password and then he can log into the system okay active is basically means
he is in the organization he is active user if I checked it it means that he is
not active so he is no more in the organization okay so basically when the
person gave a interview for system administration the interviewer asked
what is the difference between a locked out and an active or inactive right so
person has to explain that locked out user is basically the user who is active
in the system but anyhow he cannot log into the system okay and inactive means
the person is no more in the organization okay here we have web
service access only if we are doing some integration or something and we don't
want to give a interface access only web service access then we can use these
checkboxes okay email id of a user I am saying like demo user at the rate
demo.com manager if you want to give up manager of a person then you can give
the name okay calendar integration time zone okay that you can select
accordingly business and even the business phone mobile phone okay now I
am just saving it see once I clicked on save see data gets saved and new more
related list and related links get introduced okay view subscription reset
a password see roles, groups, delegate, skills, subscription, manage subscription
so here is roles so if we want to give a role to a particular person then we
can give a role from here we can click on edit button okay and we can see what
role we want to give to a user we can select a role from here let's say this
and then move this role by using this and then we can give a role to a user
when we save this then this role is assigned to that user so currently I am
not giving a role because first we have understanding of role and then we can
work on this giving a role and all okay so currently I am only creating a user
see it is not assigned to any group so that's why the group is not mentioned
over here okay so in this way we can create a user okay so see I have not
given any role to a user even though I have not assigned this user to any group
so let's login with this user let's see what kind of interface he can see
he can see so I copy this user ID and I am logging to this instance through this
user okay so here getting like this the password was 123 I'm just clicking on
login see once I click on login login sorry see this person now have access of a
service now instance okay see but the application which is available for him
is only self-service password is set connect live feed self-service basically
kind of like an employee self-service through which he can get a request okay
through truth through which he can work on knowledge or he can create a
quotient or something and there's some other like incident to create an incident
okay so he can create the tickets like request incident knowledge for himself
only he cannot work for others through this access okay so here the person
does not have any role so he is a ESS user only okay without any role now this
is a user now let's talk about rules so same as in user administration see we
have rules or you can tab rule over here okay the same menu you will get so let's
open this role in a new tab okay see we have different rules available over here
so a role is basically to specify that what different users and user group can
see and do in service now instance okay so here from here we can create a new
role so in service now there are different types of role such as like a
base system roles special administrator roles custom roles and breed only roles
so base system roles is a role which is by default provided by a service now
okay and the custom roles are the roles which we are going to create now okay
and some system administrator role are basically a base system role but it is
kind of an admin role like a business underscore rule underscore admin like
client underscore script underscore admin these are basically a system
administrator role so this provider access to a user to work on a client
scripts to work on a business rules and the read-only role like SNC underscore
read underscore only which is provided to a user if we want that he can only
read the things okay so these are basically a four categorizations of
roles okay base system role special administrator role custom role and read
only role okay so whatever role we will create from here that is basically a
custom role okay so to create a role click on new once you click on here so
you can give a role name let's say I am saying u underscore demo role the best
way is to u underscore so that you can identify that what is the custom role
what is the base role so the best practice is that whenever you are giving
a role give us u underscore in case if you are working in some different
company then they must be having some specific format to define that what is
that custom role okay I am saying now unspecified okay application global
application is basically that what all access what all application must be
having this role okay this is elevated privilege rule so
elevated privilege role is basically a role which is given to a
person for a particular time like half an hour for an hour okay so if I check
this checkbox it means it's an elevated privilege role which admin can give to
any person if you want that a person will perform a particular task for a
specified time okay such as security underscore admin is basically a
elevated privilege rule which is given to a security admin for like an hour or
I believe that for 45 minutes or 30 minutes so that he can perform his task
after that that role will automatically be removed okay so I'm not
creating an elevated privilege role okay I am saying description demo
okay I am clicking on some save just a second once I saved it see a related
list is appeared in front of us which is contained roles applications with role
tables custom application users groups so once we assign this role to any
user then that user name will get displayed over here once we assign this
role to any group then this role will be displayed over here and and if you want
that it roles contains more roles then we can add more roles in this role okay
let's say we have created a role a and then we are we wanted role B C D E will
be come in this arrow then we will create those role from here by new and
edit button and when we give this role to a particular person that
automatically that role will also get assigned to that particular person okay
means this role will become apparent and the other role will become a child which
automatically assigned once we assign this role to a user application with
role when we create a ACL or when we create application then we decided what
kind of a role people must have those who can access that application then
that will be useful and then that application will be displayed over here
okay so later on in other upcoming videos we will be covering these things
when we are creating a ACLs when we creating applications okay then we then
I will give you a demo that how that particular things will be getting
displayed over here okay so for now we will only talk about users and groups
okay once I assign this role to user then user name will get displayed over here
once I assign this role to group then group name will be displayed over here okay so this
is role this is user so through this we have become to know that how to create a
user how to create a role now let's talk about groups so type groups see under
system administration same we have a groups I will open this group in a new
tab so see here is a list of groups we already have 34 groups in the system
okay so if I talk about groups a group is basically a set of users who share
the common purpose let's say service desk group okay the for example if we
are creating an incident ticket then the incident tickets will automatically
assigned to a service desk group or some task management group which are working
on chain management or chain management group problem management groups okay
chain management group is working on a change tickets problem management group
is working on a problem tickets service desk is basically working on incident
tickets okay so to create a group click on new button so once we click on a new
button we have this form we have to fill values in it okay so name of a group I
am saying demo
B E M or demo group and I'm saying manager manager of a group I am saying
that he is the person who is taking care of this particular group is the manager
of this group in case if there is some amount which has to be paid to a group
for an early date or something you can give the values over here okay
group email id in case if you have let's say demo group and this parent of any
group in case if you have and you can give a parent from here as well so I'm
not giving right now let's click description so here once I save see we
also have a little list over here like rules if this group if we are sending
any rule to this group then we have a rule over here if you are sending any
member to this group then we have a member over here okay we are creating
any group under this group then we can get a group from here as well and we if
we want to mention some skills for this group we can also mention through the
skills from here okay so now we have created a user we have created role we
have created a group even though we have logged in through the user who does not
have any role now so now as per as the use case we have created the user we
have created a custom role we have created the group now we have to assign
the role to the user directly okay so as I told you that this is a user if I want
to assign a role to this user directly then what I will do I will create in
this role see I click on edit I am assigning him a role which name is
ITIL okay so ITIL is a very basic role which is assigned to a user if you want
that the person can work on incident person can work on a change ticket
person can work on other modules as well so ITIL role is best for that because
ITIL is basically a out-of-box technician role you can say which is by
default give provided by service now it's basically a base system role ITIL
so I am selecting ITIL over here so I am giving ITIL role to this user see and I'm
clicking on save once I click save see these roles are assigned to this user
see so here this ITIL is displayed as false inherited and other roles are
true means this ITIL role contain all these roles okay these are in these all
roles are inherited by ITIL so once we assign this ITIL role to us these
roles are automatically assigned to user okay so now this user which we have logged
in here he is having an ITIL role so let's see earlier he is having access of
only this four let's see how after assigning an ITIL role what all access
this user must have okay so I am logging it out and logging it again the
name is demo user and the password is 123 login see so now page loads
and see now he is having access of more applications now he is having access of
like this incident management he is having access of problem management he
is having access of change management okay so in this way role works so that
basically depends on role that what all access we want to give to a user what
all tasks we want a user can perform so we can decide it by giving roles okay so
in this way we can give a role to a user individual user okay but basically
giving a role to a user directly is not a good practice so good practice is
basically let us assign a role to a group and then align that user to that
group okay we will also do this in this video so okay so now here see if I
refresh this page role page and if I refresh this group page see no impact in this
related list everything is blank okay because I have not given this role to
anyone I have not assigned this group to anyone okay so what I am going to do is
now that I am assigning this role to this group so it will give us a
understanding that how to assign a role to a group okay so let's see how to
assign a role to a group so open the group click on edit you can directly
assign a role from here see we have to assign u underscore demo so I am
giving this this role to this group click on save see once I click on save
see under related list we have a role u underscore demo role which is given to
this group let's refresh this role page see now here in related list you can see
that this role is assigned to which group see here demo group okay this way we can
assign a role to a group now if we align a user to this group and what will
happen see this is demo first user which I have created earlier so what I am
going to do I am adding this user to this group so to adding a user navigate
to group members click on edit and you can select a user from here
let's say demo user and I click on save see when I click on save see group
member first demo the user name is displayed under group member role is getting
displayed over here now let's see I am refreshing this role then it will give us
a user name as well see once I refresh this see user name also populated over
here because we have given this role to a particular user through the group getting
my point so now user is also getting displayed group is also getting displayed
now this user must also having this role I am refreshing this user
where is the role see this here it get added okay so in this way the best
practice is that that whenever we have to assign a role to a user what we will
do we will add a user to that group the group which is having that role okay so
this group is having this role we added this user to this group automatically
the role is assigned to a user okay so in this way we can add user to a group
okay now let's see how we can remove role from user how we can remove role
from group removing is same that if you want to remove a role from a group
navigate to role click on edit select the role which you want to revoke
move it back now this will become blank click on save
see role is revoked now this group having a group member but does not have any role now
so if I refresh this role page now see user is removed group is removed because
the group does not have any role that means user does not have any role see so
in this way we can move the role as well and the same way we can also move the
role from the user click on edit select the role go back
see role is removed okay so in this way we can assign roles we can remove roles
we can create user we can create groups okay if we are
creating a user that user will get saved in a table which name is
sys user okay the role which we are creating over here will get saved
into sys user rule okay whatever group we are
creating it over here will get saved into sys user group so these are
basically the three tables where users roles and groups whatever we are
creating in a system getting saved okay friends so friends this is all for this
video so I hope this video helps you to understand that how we can create users
roles and groups and how we can assign roles to user okay friends so soon I will be
posting a next video of this service not training session okay so this is all for
this service not training session one so if you have not
subscribed my channel then please do subscribe my channel and please do not
forget to click on a bell icon so that you can receive a notification that what
all videos I am going to post in future thank you friends have a nice day bye
bye
